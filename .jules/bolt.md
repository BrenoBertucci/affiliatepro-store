# Bolt's Journal

## 2024-05-22 - Initial Setup
**Learning:** Performance optimization requires a baseline. Without measurements, optimization is just guessing.
**Action:** Always verify the codebase state and potential hotspots before applying changes.

## 2024-05-24 - Server-Side vs Client-Side Filtering
**Learning:** Fetching all records (`getAll()`) just to filter a few on the client is a major anti-pattern that scales poorly (O(n) network/memory vs O(1)). Supabase filters are extremely efficient.
**Action:** Always check if a filter/slice operation can be moved to the Supabase query using `.eq()` and `.limit()`.

## 2024-05-25 - Debouncing Strategy for UX
**Learning:** Debouncing the entire filter state improves API performance but degrades UX for instant controls like Categories.
**Action:** Debounce only high-frequency inputs (Search, Slider) and keep discrete inputs (Select, Checkbox) immediate.
